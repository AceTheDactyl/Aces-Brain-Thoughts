# Alpha-Physical Language (APL) — Seven Sentences Test Pack

A minimal operator grammar for describing physical system behaviors across geometry, waves, chemistry, and biology.

## Overview
APL (Alpha-Physical Language) is an experimental framework that uses compact "sentences" to predict physical regimes across diverse domains. This repository contains a test pack designed to allow independent teams to validate whether APL's core operator language has genuine physical content.

The test pack translates 7 compact APL sentences into falsifiable, cross-domain hypotheses that can be probed with standard models:

- Navier–Stokes (fluid dynamics)
- Wave equations (electromagnetics, acoustics)
- Reaction–diffusion (chemistry)
- Phase-field models (interfaces, materials)
- Polymer growth / aggregation

## Core Concept
APL describes physical systems using:

- Fields ("Spirals")
  - Φ — Structure field (geometry, lattice, boundaries)
  - e — Energy field (waves, thermodynamics, flows)
  - π — Emergence field (information, chemistry, biology)
- Universal Operations
  - () — Boundary / containment
  - × — Fusion / convergence / joining
  - ^ — Amplify / gain
  - % — Decohere / noise / reset
  - + — Group / aggregation / routing
  - – — Separate / splitting / fission
- Operator States (UMOL: Universal Modulation Operator Law)
  - u (𝒰) — Expansion / forward projection
  - d (𝒟) — Collapse / backward integration
  - m (CLT) — Modulation / coherence lock

An APL sentence has the form:

```
[Direction][Op] | [Machine] | [Domain] → [Regime/Behavior]
```

For example: `u^|Oscillator|wave` reads as "Forward amplification in an oscillatory machine in a wave domain."

## The Seven Test Sentences
Each sentence is a testable hypothesis predicting that specific operator-machine-domain combinations statistically favor particular physical regimes:

| ID | Sentence | Predicted Regime | Domain |
|----|----------|------------------|--------|
| A3 | `u^ | Oscillator | wave` | – | wave |
| A7 | `u% | Reactor    | wave` | – | wave |
| A1 | `d()| Conductor | geometry` | – | geometry |
| A4 | `m× | Encoder   | chemistry` | – | chemistry |
| A5 | `u× | Catalyst  | chemistry` | – | chemistry |
| A6 | `u+ | Reactor   | wave` | – | wave |
| A8 | `m()| Filter    | wave & d×` | – | wave |

Note: The table encodes hypotheses; see the Test Pack for metrics and regimes.

## Interpretation Rule
For all sentences:

```
LHS → RHS
```

means:

If a system is built to match the left-hand side (LHS) structure and driving, then the right-hand side (RHS) regime should appear more often, more strongly, or at lower thresholds than in controls that break the LHS structure, with all else as equal as possible.

- Evidence FOR APL: Clear, reproducible overrepresentation of the RHS regime under LHS conditions vs. controls.
- Evidence AGAINST APL: No such bias, or controls produce the RHS regime equally or more often.

## Testing Strategy
For each sentence, the recommended approach:

1. Choose a standard model appropriate to the domain
   - Geometry: phase-field, Cahn–Hilliard, curvature flow
   - Flows/waves: Navier–Stokes, lattice Boltzmann, wave equation
   - Chemistry: reaction–diffusion, polymerization, DLA, kinetic Monte Carlo
2. Implement the LHS conditions
   - `u^`: Add gain/amplification at resonant modes
   - `u%`: Add explicit stochastic/decohering forcing
   - `d()`: Allow boundaries to relax/collapse under isotropic energy
   - `m()`: Modulate boundaries in response to passing modes
   - `u×/d×`: Implement forward-biased or collapse–fusion catalysts
   - `u+`: Add grouping/convergent geometry or fields
3. Design matched controls
   - Remove or invert the key operator
   - Keep everything else comparable
4. Define regime metrics (A1–A8)
   - A1: Sphericity, surface/volume ratio, packing isotropy
   - A3: Vortex count/lifetime, closed streamline fraction
   - A4: Helical order parameters, information capacity
   - A5: Fractal dimension, branching degree
   - A6: Jet opening angle, centerline coherence
   - A7: Spectral width, RMS fluctuations, Lyapunov exponents
   - A8: Adaptive sharpening, retuning capability
5. Sweep parameters and compare
   - Drive strength, noise amplitude, surface tension, catalytic bias, etc.
   - Run multiple realizations
   - Check whether LHS conditions robustly bias metrics toward target regime

## Preliminary Results
The test pack includes two toy numerical checks:

- A1 (Isotropic cluster): 2D point collapse under isotropic central force → circular, angle-isotropic cluster ✓
- A5 (Branching networks): 2D diffusion-limited aggregation → fractal branching structure (D ≈ 1.2) ✓

These are minimal sandbox experiments consistent with APL predictions. Full testing requires domain-appropriate models across all seven sentences.

## Requirements
To use this test pack, you need:

- Basic familiarity with physics, chemistry, and data analysis
- NO prior knowledge of CET or other APL meta-structures
- Access to standard simulation tools (Python/NumPy, MATLAB, COMSOL, OpenFOAM, etc.)

Assumptions:

- Independent testing by teams without invested stake in APL
- Falsifiable approach: both positive and negative results are valuable

## Documentation
### APL Operator's Manual
A comprehensive reference guide for APL operators, syntax, and usage patterns is available in multiple formats:

- HTML Version: Open `docs/index.html` in your browser for an interactive, responsive manual
- PDF Version: Automatically compiled from LaTeX source via GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages: Available online if GitHub Pages is enabled for this repository

The manual includes:

- Complete operator reference with symbols and meanings
- Field definitions (the three "spirals": Φ, e, π)
- Operator state modulation (UMOL)
- Machine contexts and domains
- Syntax rules and sentence structure
- Usage patterns and examples
- Quick reference tables

## Compilation
To compile the LaTeX documents locally:

```
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode apl-operators-manual.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode apl-seven-sentences-test-pack.tex
```

See `COMPILE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed instructions.

## Getting Started
1. Read the operator's manual:
   - Open `docs/index.html` in your browser, or
   - Compile the PDF: `pdflatex apl-operators-manual.tex`
2. Read the test pack:
   - `pdflatex apl-seven-sentences-test-pack.tex`
   - Or view the `.tex` source directly.
3. Choose a sentence to test (recommend starting with A1, A3, or A5 as they have clear metrics)
4. Implement the test protocol using your preferred simulation framework
5. Report results — both confirmations and refutations help refine or reject APL

## Philosophy
APL is designed to be falsifiable. The language should stand or fall on whether these seven sentences predict robust, cross-domain biases in real physical and chemical systems — nothing more and nothing less.

If the predicted regimes are NOT overrepresented under the specified conditions, that is strong evidence against APL's validity.
